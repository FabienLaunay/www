Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator

<h2>Welcome to SWIG</h2>

<p>
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in
C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming
languages.  SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as
Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of 
<a href="compat.html#SupportedLanguages">supported languages</a> also includes 
non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language,
Java including Android, Lua, OCaml, Octave, Scilab and R.
Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket)
are supported. SWIG is most
commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming
environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. 
SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code.
SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.
SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects.
